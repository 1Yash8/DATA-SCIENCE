Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Google Colab (Recommended)

Python 3.x

Pandas (Pre-installed in Google Colab)

Matplotlib (For data visualization)

Steps Covered So Far

1️⃣ Checking If Pandas Is Installed

import pandas as pd  # Import pandas
print(pd.__version__)  # Check the installed version

2️⃣ Finding the Day with the Highest Pies Sold

Given Data:

Day

Pies Sold

Monday

5

Tuesday

6

Wednesday

7

Thursday

10

Friday

15

Saturday

18

Python Code:

import pandas as pd

data = {
    "Day": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"],
    "Pies Sold": [5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 18]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
max_pies_day = df.loc[df["Pies Sold"].idxmax(), "Day"]
print(f"The highest number of pies was sold on: {max_pies_day}")

✅ Output:

The highest number of pies was sold on: Saturday

3️⃣ Identifying Days Where More Than 60 Cookies Were Sold

Given Data:

Day

Cookies Sold

Monday

50

Tuesday

55

Wednesday

52

Thursday

60

Friday

65

Saturday

70

Python Code:

import pandas as pd

data = {
    "Day": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"],
    "Cookies Sold": [50, 55, 52, 60, 65, 70]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

high_cookie_sales = df[df["Cookies Sold"] > 60]  # Filter for Cookies Sold > 60
print("Days where more than 60 cookies were sold:")
print(high_cookie_sales["Day"].tolist())

✅ Output:

Days where more than 60 cookies were sold:
['Friday', 'Saturday']

4️⃣ Data Visualization (Optional)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.bar(df["Day"], df["Cookies Sold"], color="lightcoral")
plt.axhline(y=60, color="red", linestyle="--", label="Threshold: 60")
plt.xlabel("Day of the Week")
plt.ylabel("Number of Cookies Sold")
plt.title("Cookies Sold Per Day")
plt.legend()
plt.show()

✅ This will generate a bar chart showing the sales of cookies per day, with a red dashed line at 60 to highlight the threshold.

Next Steps

Continue analyzing more sales trends using different statistical methods.

Apply machine learning models to predict sales trends.

Improve data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
